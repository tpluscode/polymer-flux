<article-box />:
  - all those handlers on <Article /> violate SRP

Polymer:
  - invalid HTML breaks IE
  - remember about imports
  - computed gotcha (func requires param and value)
  - nested css works (like SCSS)
  - property doesn't have to be declared
  - function doesn't have to be declared
  - readOnly adds a private setter by convention
  - attribute vs property (dashes and camelCase respectively)

(Re)flux:
  - store triggers not used, but rather attributes published
  - example - a component invokes an actions and waits for store change. this way it is possible to add some 'middleware'

ToDo na prezentacjÄ™:
  - global loader notification element
  - improve back link by remembering last search terms
