<article-box />
  - all those handlers on <Article /> violate SRP

Polymer
  - invalid HTML breaks IE
  - remember about imports
  - computed gotcha (func requires param and value)
  - nested css works (like SCSS)
  - property doesn't have to be declared
  - function doesn't have to be declared
  - readOnly adds a private setter by convention
  - attribute vs property (dashes and camelCase respectively)

Reflux
  - trigger not used, but rather attributes published

ToDo
  - global loader notification element
  - improve back link by remembering last search terms
