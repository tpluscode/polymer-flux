Polymer:
  - invalid HTML breaks IE
    - also <table/> repeater problem
  - remember about imports
  - computed gotcha (func requires param and value)
  - property doesn't have to be declared
  - function binding
  - readOnly adds a private setter by convention
  - attribute vs property (dashes and camelCase respectively)
  - style custom properties can be overwritten

(Re)flux:
  - store triggers not used, but rather attributes published
    - maybe stores could even be replaced with pure elements ?
  - example - a component invokes an actions and waits for store change. this way it is possible to add some 'middleware'
  - maybe expose actions as events?

ToDo na prezentacjÄ™:
  - global loader notification element
  - improve back link by remembering last search terms
